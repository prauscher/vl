NOTE: Branch 'master' is the actively developed version again. Please fork if you want custom versions for your assembly.

Install
-------

First, install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [redis](http://redis.io/)

	git clone git://github.com/Waldteufel/vl.git
	cd vl
	npm install

As socket.io currently ships with an old version of the redis client library, please replace
node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/redis/lib/util.js with the following content:

	exports.util = require("util");

Configuration
-------------

Each daemon requires a file for configuration. This files are JSON and may contain the following options:

* host

  if specified, the application will only listen on this host. By default it will listen on any host.
* port *required*

  on which port the application will listen. for ports below 1024 you will need to run as root on unix-hosts. See setuid in those cases
* setuid

  setuid and setgid specify the user- and groupid, which the process will switch to when running as root. This is important when you want the daemon to listen on ports below 1024 on unix-hosts.
* setgid

  see setuid
* backend *required*

  Which backend-provider to use. Right now, you may only choose "redis" and specify further options in the redis-key.

Running
-------

After you successfully installed node, redis and the required npm modules, set up the configuration for admin and viewer
instances. Both config files are JSON and allow the same options, examples are provided in admin.conf and viewer.conf.

You can now start the projector interface using

	node viewer.js viewer.conf

Just point your Browser to the given location. Do not kill node, as the server will not daemonize atm.

To run the admin interface use

	node admin.js admin.conf

Username and passwort are at login.json. The password are tranmited in cleartext! Use a SSL-Proxy to fix it.

and go ahead just like with the projector interface.
